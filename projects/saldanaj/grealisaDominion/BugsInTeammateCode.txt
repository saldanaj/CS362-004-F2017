I tested the code for Ashley Grealish, my teammate, using my unit test cases and my random test 
units for the adventurer card.  Below is a list of bugs that were found: 


Bug 1
Title: card_Adventurer function in dominion.h/c is giving player an extra turn 	

Severity: Medium 	

Description: when the card is passed, the player is supposed to only be allowed 2 turns to 
shuffle an empty deck (if applicable), draw a card, and collect treasure based on the card 
pulled.  

As result the player data is inaccurate and incorrect.  This could lead to more bugs and 
errors.  

Symptom: The while look is configurered incorrectly.  The while loop conditional statement is 
allowing an additional turn.  

Cause/Replicate Bug: calling the card_Adventurer card and checking the state of the game after 
the function is called. You will see the players who use this card tend to result in larger 
difference in final results.

Bug 2

Title: error with card_GreatHall function in dominion.h/c giving player negative number
of actions for the state of the game

Severity: Medium 

Description: when the Great Hall card is passed to the card effect function, in other words, a 
player played this card, the original intent of the card is to increase the player's number of 
actions.  However the function is decrementing the number of actions, as a result the player is 
at a disadvantage.  Furthermore the variable itself, number of actions, could potentially arrive 
to a negative number if decremented enough and if value is not fully restored.  Ultimately 
locking a user out of performing any actions.  

Symptom: the function is decrementing rather than incrementing the states number of actions
Case/Replicate Bug: calling the great_Hall function and monitoring the states number of actions 
and verify via debbuging the variable at one point is negative.  

Cause/Replicate Bug: ensure a user has the great hall card and play the card

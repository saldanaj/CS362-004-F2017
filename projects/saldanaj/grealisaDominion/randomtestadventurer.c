 Description: This is the random test generator
 for the adventurer card
 
 Below is the code for the adventurer card function that was refactored in assignment 2:
 
 int adventurerCard(struct gameState *state)
 {
 int drawntreasure = 0;
 int currentPlayer = whoseTurn(state);
 int cardDrawn;
 int temphand[MAX_HAND];
 int z = 0;
 
 while(drawntreasure<2)
 {
 if (state->deckCount[currentPlayer] <1)
 {//if the deck is empty we need to shuffle discard and add to deck
 shuffle(currentPlayer, state);
 }
 
 drawCard(currentPlayer, state);
 
 cardDrawn = state->hand[currentPlayer][state->handCount[currentPlayer]-1];//top card of hand is most recently drawn card.
 
 // DEBUG removed the "cardDrawn == silver" statement from the if statement below
 if (cardDrawn == copper || cardDrawn == gold)
 drawntreasure++;
 else
 {
 temphand[z]=cardDrawn;
 state->handCount[currentPlayer]--; //this should just remove the top card (the most recently drawn one).
 z++;
 }
 }
 
 while(z-1 >= 0)
 {
 state->discard[currentPlayer][state->discardCount[currentPlayer]++]=temphand[z-1]; // discard all cards in play that have been drawn
 z=z-1;
 }
 
 return 0;
 
 }
